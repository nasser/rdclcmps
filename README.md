Radical Computer Science at SFPC, Abbreviated

A one day abbreviation of the [full Radical Computer Science class](http://nas.sr/teaching/2016/radical-computer-science/) at SFPC. Our goal is to begin to understand computation so that we may build tools to empower humans to be more expressive.

## Readings
* [A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages](http://history-computer.com/Library/Kay72.pdf) by Alan Kay, for a perspective on what early computing researchers imagined the experience of programming could be like.
* [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) by [Brett Victor](http://worrydream.com), for a more contemporary critique of traditional programming used in an educational or creative context.

## Videos
* [Tulip: A Language for Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvclTCDeIsY&t=1s), for an example of a radically new programming language effort.
